2. Sells 3 types of items:
    - Burger
    - Side
    - Drink
All items that are a part of a combo will be discounted by 15%

4. Needs to provide a class named Inventory that contains the following methods:
    - get_number_of_items(): an async method that returns the number of unique items in the restaurants catalogue
    - get_catalogue(): an async method that returns a dictionary containing the restaurants catalogue
    - get_stock(item_id): Async method that returns the quantity of an item in the inventory based on its item_id
    - decrement_stock(item_id): An async method that decrements the count of an item in the inventory based on its item_id
    - get_item(item_id): An async method that returns the details abt a specific item based on its item_id 

5. Program run flow:
    - Start by greeting customer
    - Display available items via show_catalogue(catalogue) function
    - Take order by asking user to select item by entering item_id showed on show_catalogue 
        - user input validation required
        - check stock, inform user if required item is out of stock 
        - q to complete order (take teh case of empty order into consideration)

    - Automatically create any possible combos and display an order summary
